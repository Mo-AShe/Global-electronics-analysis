Analysis for the sales of electronics...

I am excited to share with you my first project in data analysis  ðŸŽŠ.

I worked really hard for this project to make insights based on the data set of Global electronics between 2016 and 2021.

This dataset is not goal oriented so that I can give insights that achieve the goals so I put a goal by myselfðŸ˜Ž .



These goals are :

1-what is the most currency used ?

2-what is the most package type that is picked ?

3-what is the store that has the highest number package picked ?

4-give a detailed information about packages produced.

5-give insights to increase the sales.



So , to answer all of these questions I visualize all the tables needed (not all the tables in the dataset are useful to answer these questions) in form of multipage report using Microsoft Power Bi tool and I found it enough to help me.



The answer for the first question is the Doller  currency.

As from the first page it can be noticed that from the "Number of Customers by Currency Code" pie chart that most of the customers use currency with code "USD" which means Doller  currency.



The answer for the first question is the first package type.

The column chart named "Number of packages by Quantity of packages" shows that the number of fist type package is the highest.



  The answer for the third question is the store with store key "0"(means online store.

It is not surprising that customers buy packages from online store in high rate rather than land stores. This peace of information is based on the "Line chart" named "Total number of packages by StoreKey" in "Customers" page.

Note: I considered each store with its unique store key which referred to it.



The answer for the fourth is not just a single information rather than details and facts.

Day 20 is the day which has the largest number of packages sold.

Month December has the largest   number of packages sold.

year 2019  has the largest   number of packages sold.

United States is the top country in number of customers and the packages sold.

State California has the highest number of customers.

United States has the largest number of stores.

United States has the largest number of state that contain stores.



The answer for the fifth is the list of insights that I give:

1-make the marketing online in wider range.

2-update the online stores.

3-improve the service in  U.S. 

4- make new stores in other countries as they are promising.  

5-improve service in stores that they have heigh number of customer e.g. New York and Georgia in U.S. and Queensland in Australia (the priority for states that has more than 200 customer).

 

When I study the dataset I found two columns named "Order date" and "Delivery date" , I notice that some of the values of column "Delivery date" is not assigned. I conclude that the packages didn't deliver to the customer ,although the same customer may make  more that one order and some of them delivered and some of them don't .

So, I found that it is a serous problem as the delivered packages consists of 20.94% and  fail to deliver consists of  79.06% from the total delivery of the packages.

To solve this problem I recommend to wide the stores in many states(as mentioned earlier)  and focus on online stores especially. As the online stores has the least delivery fails and the highest delivery success. Also, the income from the online stores can cover the land stores requirements to be improved.
